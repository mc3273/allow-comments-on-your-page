						<h3> Basic HTML Vocabulary </h3>	

          		<p class="one">
          			<br> 
								<b> Tag: </b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (" p " ' for example) and a closing tag, ("p"). Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the "br" tag).

								<br> 
								<b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.

								<br> 
								<b> Attribute:  </b> This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL,  " a href="www.udacity.com"  

								<br> Span and Div will be used often in this class! 							
								<b> Span is Inline and Div is a block element </b>

						<h3> Unit 1 Summary </h3>	

          		<p class="one">
          			<b> 1) What a Web Page is </b> - A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
          			<br>
          			<b> 2) How Coding Works </b> - Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. 
          			<br>
          			<b> 3) Computers are Not so "SMART" </b> - Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax"). For example, if you forget to close a bold tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer than you can tell it do do anything you want.
          			<br>
          			<b> 4) Programmers Can't Remember Everything </b> - There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.

          	<h1> Stage 1: Unit 3</h1>
          	<h3>Style and Structure with CSS </h3>
          		<p class="one">

	 				<b> CSS Files </b> - You can have several sheets, all will be used to define page styles, think of it as laws that make the whole. The most specific rule is applied to every element, refers to cascading 	
	 			<br>
	 				<b> Order Matters </b>

					It also matters where you define the rules and in what order they are applied. Styles can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order, with definitions further down the list overwriting previous definitions: the default style of a browser (different browsers have slightly different styles)
					stylesheet in a separate file (this is what you will be mostly using)stylesheet inside HTML (this can be done for small projects but is not ideal) inline style in an element (this can also be done but should be avoided)

				<br>	
					<b> Specifics Matter </b>

					"Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.

					That idea is known as inheritance and understanding it requires abstract thinking.
				<br>
						<b> Selecter </b>
				<br>	
					Write style that applies to class  e.g. description 
					Combine selectors 
					Very nice article on CSS selectors.

				</p>
			<h3>Selecting a Class </h3>
          		<p class="one">

	 				<b> Classing HTML elements </b> - makes it possible to define CSS styles for classes of elements.
	 			<br>		
					Equal styles for equal classes, or different styles for different classes.
				<br>
					 If you only want to add style to certain h1s, you can use class selectors. 
				<br>
					<b> Classing Block Elements </b>
				<br>

					The HTML "div" element is a block level element. It can be used as a container for other HTML elements.
				<br>	
					Classing "div" elements, makes it possible to define equal styles for equal "div" elements:
				<br>
					<b> Classing Inline Elements </b>
				<br>
					The HTML "span" element is an inline element that can be used as a container for text.
				<br>
					<b> Classing "span" elements </b> - makes it possible to design equal styles for equal "span" elements.

		<h3> Including CSS Styling in the web page </h3>
		<div class="flex-item-4"> 
							<h4>Method One: <br> Write CSS in the "head" of your HTML</h4> 
							<ul> 
                      		This method is good for very small projects (like what you'd do in scratchpad.io). 
                      		<li> At the top of your HTML document, add a "head" element. </li>
                      		<li> Inside the "head" element, add a "style" element. </li>
                      		<li> Write your CSS in the "style" element and then put the HTML for the rest of your page below.</li>
                      		</ul>
						</div> 

		<div class="flex-item-5"> 
							<h4>Method 2: <br> Link your HTML to a separate CSS file </h4> 
							<ul> 
								This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects. To do this:
                      			<li>Write all of your structural HTML in one file (let's call it main.html).</li>
                      			<li>In a separate file (let's call it main.css), put all of your CSS code.</li>
                      			<li>Add a "head" element to the top of your HTML.</li>
                      			<li>Add a "link" tag inside the "head" element. Since "link" is a "void tag" you don't need to add a closing "link". </li>

                  			</ul> 

											</div> <!-- flex item 2 close -->		

		<div class="flex-item-6"> 
							<h4>Method 3: <br> Write your style inline with your HTML</h4> 
							<ul> 
                      		Generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code
                      		<br>
                      		<li>But you may see code that uses this method so it's good to be familiar with it. </li>
                      		<li>Check out the question and answers in this conversation on Stack Overflow (Stack Overflow is the most widely used programming Q/A community out there). </li>
                      		<li>With this method, you modify the style attributes of every individual HTML element. </li>

                  			</ul> 

						</div> 
	</div> <!-- flex container close --> 		
			<h3>Browsers  </h3>
          		<p class="one">

	 				<b> Browsers </b>  use default stylesheets to determine how to display HTML elements. You can view the default style rules for h1 and other elements for the following browsers:
	 			<br>		
					<b> WebKit </b> (Chrome and Safari) <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css"> Web Kit Link </a>
				<br>
					<b> Firefox </b>  <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/layout/style/html.css"> Fire Fox Link </a> 
				<br>
					Because these rules differ sometimes between browsers, there are efforts to promote consistency in styles across browsers. One popular solution to this issue is using what is referred to as a CSS reset such as normalize.css.  http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
				</p>
			<h3>Box Sizing  </h3>
          		<p class="two">

	 				HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.
					Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
					There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.
	 			<br>		
					<b> Code  -  Test   - Refine </b>
					<br>
						<b>Structure</b> - Visually Box 
						Tags - heading 
						Size of the boxes 
						How to position 
						Once layout is complete 
						Time for smaller details 
				<br>
					<b>Look for Natural Boxes </b>
					Look for repeated styles and Semantic elements 
					Write your HTML 
					Apply Styles  (big to small)
					Fix the small things

			<h3>Overview of Programming </h3>
          	<p class="one">

          	<b> Programming </b> is the core of computer science.
          <br>	
				A computer is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do any mechanical computation you can imagine.
			<br>		
				A program describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the program must give the steps in away that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can be followed without any thought.

			<br> 

			<br>
				<b>Python</b> is a programming language. The programs that we write in the Python language will be the input to the Python interpreter, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.
          	<br>
          	</p>  
      <div class="unit2"> 
          <h1> Stage 2: Unit 2</h1>
          <h3>Why Python!</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		Why should you learn new languages, like Python, to program computers, rather than using natural languages like English or Mandarin?
          	<br>
          		There are many reasons why a designed language like Python is better for writing programs than a natural language like English. 
          	<br>	
          		One problem with natural languages is that they are <b> ambiguous </b>. Hence, not everyone will interpret the same phrase the same way. To program computers, it is important that we know exactly what our programs mean, and that the computer will run them with the meaning we intended. 
          	<br>
          		Another problem with natural language is that they are very <b> verbose </b>. To say something with the level of precision needed for a computer to be able to follow it mechanically would require an awful lot of writing. You want your programs to be short so it is less work to write them, and so that it is easier to read and understand them.
          	</p>  
          <h3>"Grammer" in Python</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		Compared to a natural language, programming languages adhere to a <b> strict grammatical structure</b>. In English, even if a phrase is written or spoken incorrectly, it can still be understood with the help of context or other cues. On the other hand, in a <b>programming language like Python, the code must match the language grammar exactly.</b> The Python interpreter has no idea what to do with input that is not in the Python language, so it produces an error.
          	<br>
          		When programming language grammar is not followed the interpreter will return a <b>SyntaxError</b> message. This means that the structure of the code is inconsistent with the rules of the programming language.
          	</p>  	
          <h3>"Backus-Naur Form</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		The notation we used to describe the grammar is known as <b> Backus-Naur Form </b>, which was introduced in the 1950s by John Backus, the lead designer of the Fortran programming language at IBM.
          	<br>
          		The purpose of Backus-Naur Form is to describe a programming language in a <b> simple and concise manner</b>. The structure of this form is:
          	<br>
					<b>"Non-Terminal to replacement" </b>
				<br>
					The replacement can be any sequence of zero or more non-terminals or terminals.
				<br>
					Terminals never appear on the left side of a rule. Once you get to a terminal there is nothing else you can replace it with. 
				<br>
					The important thing about a replacement grammar is that we can describe an infinitely large language with a small set of precise rules.	
          	</p>  
          <h3>"Expressions" in Python</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		The Expression non-terminal that appears on the left side can be replaced by an Expression, followed by an Operator, followed by another Expression. For example, 1 + 1 is an Expression Operator Expression.
          	<br>
          		The interesting thing about this rule is that it has Expression on both the left and right sides! This looks circular, and would be, except we also have other rules for Expression that do not include Expression on the right side. This is an example of a recursive definition. To make a good recursive definition you need at least two rules:
          	<br>
					<b>A rule that defines something in terms of itself. </b>
				<br>
					<b> Expression to Number </b>
				<br>	
					Recursive definitions are a very powerful idea in computer science. They allow us to define infinitely many things using a few simple rules.
			<h3>"Admiral Grace Hopper" (1906 - 1992)</h3>
          	<p class="two">
          		<img src="http://www.m-w.co.uk/sites/default/files/public/images/grace-hopper.jpg" style="max-width:40%;" alt="Grace Hopper">
          	<br>	
          		Grace Hopper was a pioneer in computing who was known for walking around with nanosticks. Nanosticks are pieces of wire that are the length light travels in a nanosecond, about 30 cm.
          	<br>
          		Hopper wrote one of the first programming languages, COBOL, which was for a long time the world's most widely used programming language. Hopper built the first compiler. A compiler is a program that takes as input a program in a programming language easy for humans to write and outputs a program in another language that is easier for computers to execute. The difference between a compiler and an interpreter like Python is that a compiler does all the work at once and creates a new program, whereas, the interpreter converts the source code one step at a time as the program runs.

          <h3>Variables</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		A <b> variable </b> is a name that refers to a value. In Python, we can use any sequence of letters and numbers and underscores (_)when we want to make a variable name, so long as it does not start with a number.<p>

          	<br>
          		<p>To introduce a new variable, we use an assignment statement:<b> Name = Expression </b></p>

				<br>
					<p>After executing an assignment expression, the name refers to the value of the expression on the right side of the assignment. We can use the variable name anywhere we want and it means the same things as the value it refers to.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p><b> Variables Can Vary </b> - The value a variable refers to can change. When a variable name is used, it always refers to the last value assigned to that variable<p>
          	<br>
          		<p>When we use the same variable on both sides of an assignment. The right side is evaluated first, using the current value of the variable. Then the assignment is done using that value.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p> Remember that although we use <b> = for assignment </b> it does not mean equality. You should think of the = sign in Python as an arrow, , showing that the value the right side evaluates to is being assigned to the variable name on the left side. </p>
          <h3>Comments</h3>	
          	<br>	
          		We use the hash mark (#) to introduce a comment. After the hash, we can write anything we want. The rest of the line is treated as a comment. The comment is not interpreted by the Python interpreter, but it is useful for humans reading the code. 
          <h3>Strings</h3>	
          		<p class="two"> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQqyTSS6adrLa9mNNrIH6QLmLqoUFzioT8X6MYqeY5i_iypx2zx" style="max-width:50%;" alt="String"> </p>

          		<p class="two"> <img src="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ricardoduarte/python-for-developers/blob/master/Chapter5/bpyfd_diags4.png" style="max-width:50%;" alt="Strings"> </p>
          		<br>
          		A <b>string</b> is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes, either single or double.The only requirement is that the string must start and end with the same kind of quote.<p>

          		<b> Double quotes:</b> This allows you to include quotes inside of quotes as a character in the string.</p>

          <h3>Strings and Numbers</h3>	
          		We can also use the plus operator (+) on strings, but it has a different meaning from when it is used on numbers. With string, plus means concatenation.

          	<br>
          		<p>You can create a space between the strings by adding a space to one of the strings. You can also continue to add strings as many times as you need.</p>
          <h3>Indexing Strings</h3>	
          		When you want to select sub-sequences from a string, it is called indexing. Use the square brackets [] to specify which part of the string you want to select: <string>[<expression>]

          		<p>Indexing strings is the most useful when the string is given using a variable:</p>	

          		<p>When you use negative numbers in the index, Python starts counting from the back of the string:</p>

          <h3>Finding Strings in Strings</h3>	
          		The find method is a built in operation, or method, provided by Python, that operates on strings. The output of find is the position of the string where the specified sub-string is found.

					<p> If the target string is not found anywhere in the search string, then the output will be -1. </p>

          		<p>In addition to passing in a target string to find, you can also pass in a number:</p>	

          		<p>The number input is the position in the search string where find will start looking for the target string. So, the output is a number giving the position of the first occurrence of the target string in the search string at, or after the input position. If there is no occurrence at or after that position, the output is -1.</p>	

           <h3>Functions</h3>	

           		<p class="two"> <img src="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/weblog/images/basic-function-tartley.png" style="max-width:75%;" alt="Function"> 

          		<p><b> Procedures or Functions </b> - a way to package code so it can be reused with different inputs.</p>

				<p><b>Control</b> - a way to have the computer execute different instructions depending on the data (instead of just executing instructions one after the other).</p>

				<p> Procedural abstraction is a way to write code once that works on any number of different data values. By turning our code into a procedure, we can use that code over and over again with different inputs to get different behaviors. </p>

          		<p>A <b> procedure</b> takes in inputs, does some processing, and produces outputs.</p>	

          		<p>The keyword def is short for "define".</p>

				<p><b>"name"</b> is the name of a procedure. Just like the name of a variable, it can be any string that starts with a letter and followed by letters, number and underscores.</p>

				<p><b>"parameters"</b> are the inputs to the procedure. A parameter is a list of zero or more names separated by commas: "name", "name",... Remember that when you name your parameters, it is more beneficial to use descriptive names that remind you of what they mean. Procedures can have any number of inputs. If there are no inputs, the parameter list is an empty set of closed parentheses.</p>

				<p>The body of the procedure is a "block", which is the code that implements the procedure. The block is indented inside the definition. Proper indentation tells the interpreter when it has reached the end of the procedure definition.</p>	

				<p> To finish the procedure, we need to produce the outputs. To do this, introduce a new Python statement called <b>return</b>. A return statement can have any number of expressions. The values of these expressions are the outputs of the procedure.</p>

				<p>A return statement can also have no expressions at all, which means the procedure produces no output. This may seem silly, but in fact it is quite useful. Often, you want to define procedures for their side-effects, not just for their outputs. Side-effects are visible, such as the printing done by a print statement, but are not the outputs of the procedure.</p>

				<p> Procedures are a very important concept and the core of programming is breaking problems into procedures, and implementing those procedures.</p>
		<h3>Comparison Operators</h3>	
          	<p class="two"> <img src="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/introductiontoprogrammingwithpython-lecture1-140910085055-phpapp02/95/introduction-to-programming-with-python1-18-638.jpg?cb=1410357683" style="max-width:125%;" alt="Comparison Operator"> 
          	<br>			
				Python provides several operators for making comparisons. All of these operators act on numbers.</p>	
		<h3>If/Or Statements </h3>	
          		<p class="two"> <img src="http://img.c4learn.com/2012/03/if-statement-in-java-programming-language1.png" style="max-width:75%;" alt="If Statement"> 
          	<br>			
				An if statement provides a way to control what code executes based on the result of a test expression.</p>

				<p>You can use an else clause in addition to an if statement to provide alternative code that will execute when the test expression is false. The test expression determines whether to execute the block inside the if statement or the block inside the else statement.</p>	

				<p> An <b> or expression </b> gives the logical or (disjunction) of two operands. If the first expression evaluates to True, the value is True and the second expression is not evaluated. If the value of the first expression evaluates to False then the value of the or is the value of the second expression.</p>

				<p>An important difference between an or expression and other operators is that an or expression does not necessarily evaluate both of its operand expressions </p>

        <h3>While Loops </h3>	
          		<p class="two"> <img src="http://www.c-programming-simple-steps.com/images/Loops_Pre-conditionLoop.png" style="max-width:100%;" alt="While Loop "> 
          	<br>			
				Loops are a way of executing something over and over.</p>

				<p>In contrast to an if statement where the block executes either 0 or 1 times depending on whether the test expression is True or False, <b> a while loop executes any number of times, continuing as long as the test expression is True.</b></p>	

				<p> In a if statement if the test expression is True, the block executes once and then continues to the following statement. If the test expression is False, execution jumps over the block and continues with the following statement.
			<br>
				<p> The test expression for a while loop is True, the block is executed. Then, execution continues by going back to the test expression again. If it still evaluates to True, the block is executed again, and execution continues by going back to the test expression one more time. This continues as long as the test expression evaluates to True. and again as many times as you need. Once the test expression is False, execution jumps to the next statement. There is no guarantee that the test expression eventually becomes False, however. The loop could keep running forever, which is known as an infinite loop.</p>  

				<p> <b> Break </b> gives us a way to break out of a loop, even if the test condition is true.</p>

          	<p class="one">
          		A string is considered a kind of structured data because you can break it down into its characters and you can operate on sub-sequences of a string. This unit introduces <b> lists </b>, a more powerful and general type of structured data.

		<h3>Nested Lists </h3>	

          		<p>			
				All of the elements in our lists have been of the same type: strings, numbers, etc. However, there are no restrictions on the types of elements in a list. Elements of a list can be any type you want, you can also mix and match different types of elements in a list.</p>
			<br>

		<h3> Mutation </h3>	
          		<p class="two"> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ4EPCz6DLbT2QtmnBLDvO9C-d3zcqkwCNp0wXsRAARUzt8QcWMFg" style="max-width:75%;" alt="mutation"> </p>

				<p><b>Mutation</b> means changing the value of an object. Lists support mutation. This is the second main difference between strings and lists.</p>		
				<p>This operation may look like it is changing the value of the string, but that's not what happens. It is not modifying the value of any string, but instead is creating a new string, 'Yellow', and assigning the variable s to refer to that new string. <b> Lists can be mutated, thus changing the value of an existing list. </b></p>	

		<h3> Aliasing</h3>	

          		<p><b>Aliasing </b>is when there are two names that refer to the same object. Aliasing is very useful, but also can be very confusing since one mutation can impact many variables. If something happens that changes the state of the object, it affects the state of the object for all names that refer to that object.

				Strings are Immutable. Note that we cannot mutate strings, since they are immutable objects.</p>		
				<p><b>Mutable</b> and <b>Immutable Objects</b>. The key difference between mutable and immutable objects, is that once an object is mutable, you have to worry about other variables that might refer to the same object. You can change the value of that object and it affects not just variable you think you changed, but other variables that refer to the same object as well.</p>	

          		<p>Sometime in the future you will be writing a program and you will find that a variable does not have the value you expected. The cause may be that you changed the value of a variable that you thought was different but actually wasn't (due to the aliasing you just learned about).</p>
			</p> 

		<h3> List Operations </h3>	
          		<p class="two"> <img src="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/python1-140710074239-phpapp02/95/scripting-in-python-11-638.jpg?cb=1404996795" style="max-width:75%;" alt="mutation"> </p>

				<p>A list object has a number of member methods. These can be grouped arbitrarily into transformations, which change the list, and information, which returns a fact about a list.There are many built-in operations on lists. Use the Python Reference for help! </p>	

		<h3> Loops on Lists </h3>	

				<p>Since lists are collections of things, it is very useful to be able to go through a list and do something with every element. </p>

				<p>In Python there is a more convenient way to loop through the elements of a list: <b> the for loop. </b> </p>

				<p> Let's walk-through what happens when you apply this for loop to a list:
				<br>
    			<p> mylist = [1, 2, 3]
    			print_all_elements(mylist) </p>
    			<br>
				When you pass in mylist to print_all_elements the variable p will refer to the list that contains the three elements, 1, 2 and 3. When the loop is executed, the variable e is assigned to the first element in the list, and the body of the loop will print the first element. So, for the first iteration the valueofewillbe1. Theblockisexecuted,printingout1. Sincetherearemoreelementsinthelist, executioncontinues,assigning2tothee. Again,theblockisexecuted,butthistimeitprintsout2. Execution continues for the third iteration, which prints out 3. There are no more elements in the list, so the for loop is complete and execution continues with the next statement (in this case, there is no following statement, so execution finishes).</p>

		<h3> Index </h3>	

				<p>There are many other ways to define find_element. A built-in list operation that we have not yet introduced that makes it easier to write find_element is the index method:</p>

				<p>The method index() returns the lowest index in list that obj appears.</p>

				<p>Example
				   The following example shows the usage of index() method.

					<p>

					aList = [123, 'xyz', 'zara', 'abc']; </p>

					<p>print "Index for xyz : ", aList.index( 'xyz' ) ;</p>
					<br>
					<p>print "Index for zara : ", aList.index( 'zara' ) ;</p>

          <h3>Power of Abstration</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p>Abstraction is a core concept in all of computer science. The process of generalizing in order to manage intellectual complexity. It may involve identifying common elements between different instances, or identifying the most important elements of a given instance and intentionally disregarding other elements.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>It is the power of abstraction that makes the creation of large, complex software systems possible. </p>
          	<br>	
          		<p> <b>Abstracting</b> something means to give names to things, so that the name captures the core of what a function or a whole program does. </p>  
          <h3>"Python Functions"</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p> A  <b>function</b> is a named sequence of statements that belong together. Their primary purpose is to help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem. </p>
          	<br>
          		<p> The syntax for a function definition is:
  				<b> def NAME( PARAMETERS ):STATEMENTS </b> </p>
  			<br>
  				<p> You can make up any names you want for the functions you create, except that you can’t use a name that is a Python keyword, and the names must follow the rules for legal identifiers.
				There can be any number of statements inside the function, but they have to be indented from the def.-If statements, Loops, and functions  </p>
			<br>
				<p>Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of statements. Functions can simplify a program by hiding a complex computation behind a single command. The function (including its name) can capture your mental chunking, or abstraction, of the problem.</p>
			<br>
				<p> Creating a new function can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.</p>
          	</p>  	
          <h3>"Python Loops" </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p>A <b>while loop</b> statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>The syntax of a while loop in Python programming language is −while expression:statement(s)</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>Statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.</p>

     	<h3>"Python Infinate Loops" </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p>A loop becomes <b>infinite </b> loop if a condition never becomes false. You must use caution when using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a false value. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to run continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when required.</p>	
         <h3>"The Else Statement Used with Loops" </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p>Python supports to have an else statement associated with a loop statement.If the else statement is used with a for loop, the else statement is executed when the loop has exhausted iterating the list.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>If the else statement is used with a while loop, the else statement is executed when the condition becomes false.</p>  

         <h3>"Python Class" </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p> <b>Class</b> A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.</p>
          	<br>
          		<p>Classes give us the ability to create more complicated data structures that contain arbitrary content.</p>	
          	<br>
          		<p>For Example: Class e.g. class Turtle. Neatly package box allows us to write code like turtle.Turtle()."A class Turtle, much like a blueprint, contains certain pieces of information about a turtle: the turtle's size, its color, the fact that the Turtle can move forward..."It would be more accurate to say that the class Turtle indicates the fact that it has a size and a color. Individual instances of the Turtle will contain information about their sizes and their colors. </p>	

         <h3>"Code Re-Use" </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p>Code reuse, also called software reuse, is the use of existing software, or software knowledge, to build new software, following the reusability principles.</p>

          		<p>Use what's out there to become a more efficient programmer.For Example: Stack Overflow, Google, Github, many many more...</p>
         <h3>"More on Classes!" </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p><b>Using Classes</b> When we call web browser open calling function. When we call turtle the int inside turtle get's called 
          	<br>
          		<p><b>1) </b> A class is a set of instructions with predefined capabilities. <b> 2)</b> An instance is like a copy of the instructions that it remembers. You can create many copies that are independent to each other. <b> 3) </b> A class is a like DNA, where by knowing the capabilities, you can create many instances of it.Lesson 2b Send Text (using Classes).</p>	
          	<br>
          		<p>A class is a container or blueprint that holds all the attributes of a particular set of objects that are yet to be created. To be specific it holds the data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods that are called on via dot notation. <b> For example </b> within the class turtle there is a class Turtle and we call it by creating an instance or object like: brad = turtle.Turtle()</p>	  
          	<br>
          		<p>An instance of a class is an object created that is an example of what can be made with a class and different attributes of the class can be called specifically and defined.</p>	
          	<br>
          		<p>A class might be similar to a genome of an animal in that it is the container of instructions or potential makeup of an organism. A class defined as human is defined by certain boundaries of its attributes and functions that make it genuinely human, but there is room within this class to generate many and indeed infinite permutations of the variable and methods that define what it is to be human. Hair Color ranging from white to black to blonde to brown with each instance potentially different. A method might be walking upright on two feet.</p>	

         <h3>"An Instance of a Class" </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p>A class is a neatly packaged box that puts things together really well. It allows us to write code such as turtle.Turtle() as if we were calling a function. When we run this code we are really running the function def init , or 'initialize' in class Turtle - and it creates space in the computer's memory for us to perform different tasks within Turtle. </p>
          	<br>
          		<p>An instance of a class allows us to use a particular class to serve whatever purpose we need it to serve in for whatever program we may be writing in Python. An instance is something we can give a variable name to using an assignment. We can than use that name to call different functions inside the class using said name. If we run the assignment brad = turtle.Turtle() , we can then use code such brad.forward(100) to utilize the forward function from within class Turtle, which is nested inside module turtle.</p>

          	<p class="one">
          		<p><b> What is a Network</b> A network is a group of entities that can communicate, even though they are not directly connected. Webopedia explains a Network this way : A network is a group of two or more computer systems linked together. There are many types of computer networks, including the following: </p>
          	<br>
          		<p>local-area networks (LANs): The computers are geographically close together (that is, in the same building).</p>
          		<p>wide-area networks (WANs): The computers are farther apart and are connected by telephone lines or radio waves.</p>
          		<p>campus-area networks (CANs): The computers are within a limited geographic area, such as a campus or military base.</p>
          		<p>metropolitan-area networks MANs): A data network designed for a town or city.</p>
          		<p>home-area networks (HANs): A network contained within a user's home that connects a person's digital devices.</p>

          		<p><b> How to make a network work</b> 1)We need a way to encode and interpret messages 2)We need a way to route messages 3)We need rules </p>

          		<p><b> Measuring Networks</b> </p>

          		<p><b> Latency</b> Time it takes for a message to get from the source to the destination, from the start of the message, unit of time measured in milliseconds today </p>

          		<p><b> Bandwith</b> Amount of information that can be transmitted per unit time, once you have some part of the message across what is the rate it can be received. Can be measured in MBPS(Megs bit's per second) </p>

          		<p><b> Bit</b> 1 bit = smallest unit of information, in computing we think of it as 0 and 1, If you have more bits you can encode more things</p>

          		<p> A  <b>HTML structure</b> An HTML 4 document is composed of three parts: </p>

				<p> 1) A line containing HTML version information </p>
				<p> 2) A declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element) </p>
				<p> 3) A body, which contains the document's actual content. The body may be implemented by 	the BODY element or the FRAMESET element. </p>

          	<br>
          		<p> <b>What is a Query Parameter </b> a parameter query is a query that prompts the user to enter specific criteria every time the query is run.</p>
  			<br>
  				<p> <b>What is Caching </b> A cache (pronounced like cash) is something that stores data so that you don't have to retrieve it later. It can be used to make data requests faster. For more information, this page has a good explanation.</p>
			<br>
				<p> <b>Breaking down a URL</b></p>

				<p> <b>http://:</b> "HTTP" stands for Hypertext Transfer (or Transport) Protocol, and is the identification technology used to communicate between Web servers and the users who access their information. </p>

				<p> <b>domain name: </b> The domain name is the textual representation of the IP address, used to identify a specific Web page or pages, and comes after the "://". </p>

				<p> <b>forward slash,then file name:</b> Path or Directory on the computer to a file </p>

				<p> <b>name of file:</b> name of file, usually ending in .html or .htm. </p>

				<p> A  <b>HTTP (Get and Post) Method </b>Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST.

				<p> <b> GET - Requests data from a specified resource </b> Note that query strings (name/value pairs) is sent in the URL of a GET request. GET requests can be cached, GET requests remain in the browser history, GET requests can be bookmarked, GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data, GET requests have length restrictions, and GET requests should be used only to retrieve data. 

				<p> <b> POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource </b> Note that query strings (name/value pairs) is sent in the HTTP message body of a POST request: POST requests are never cached, POST requests do not remain in the browser history, GET requests can be bookmarked, POST requests cannot be bookmarked, and POST requests have no restrictions on data length. 

				<p> <b>Absolute vs. Relative Path</b></p>An absolute path is the full URL to a file. A relative path points to the location of the file you want to link to in relation to the page being viewed, all within your server space. Both links take you to the same page, but there's a big difference in the way they perform. By using a relative path, the browser knows to just look within your own web site's server space for the linked file. However, if you use the absolute path, the browser goes back out onto the Internet and finds your site all over again, then finds the file within your directory. So, if you're linking to pages on your own site, using a relative path will make your site respond quicker. </p>

Servers can run on any computer including dedicated computers, which individually are also often referred to as "the server". </p>

    	<h3>4.4: Python Break Modules and Dictionaries</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p> <b>The Modulus Operator:</b> This is an operator (like +, -, *, or /) that every programming language has. You are likely to see code that uses it in the future, and this section will ensure that you have an idea of what that code does. % takes a number and maps to the range based on the remainder when you divide the number </p>

				<p> <b>Dictionaries:</b> This is another data structure, similar to a Python List. You will use code that uses dictionaries in the next lesson.A dictionary data structure is one which is capable of storing objects in sorted order based on key such as a string or an integer. For instance, say you have several hundred Base objects which consist of the name of the Base, the latitude and longitude at which it is located, and its armaments. One way of storing these cities is to sort them by name; another is to store them in decreasing order by armaments; yet another is in increasing order by latitude. Primarily, the dictionary component will store objects based on some sort of a string key, such as the name of a Base or Target. The main purpose of the dictionary is to provide us with an easy way to see what data points we have already entered into our SoftWar database. The term data dictionary will be used in class to refer to this component, or to a collection of components having this role.</p>

          <h3>4.5: Working with Google App Engine</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p> <b>Google App Engine </b> lets you build and run applications on Google’s infrastructure. App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs change. With App Engine, there are no servers for you to maintain. You simply upload your application and it’s ready to go </p>

				<p> App Engine executes your Python application code using a pre-loaded Python interpreter in a safe "sandboxed" environment. Your app receives web requests, performs work, and sends responses by interacting with this environment.The Python interpreter can run any Python code, including Python modules you include with your application, as well as the Python standard library. The interpreter cannot load Python modules with C code; it is a "pure" Python environment.</p>

				<p> Google App Engine <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/"> App Engine</a>	

				<p> App Engine includes a simple web application framework, called webapp2. The webapp2 framework is already installed in the App Engine environment and in the SDK, so you do not need to bundle it with your application code to use it.  </p>

				<p> A <b> webapp2 application </b> has two parts: 1) one or more RequestHandler classes that process requests and 2) build response a WSGIApplication instance that routes incoming requests to handlers based on the URL </p>

				<p> The fundamental differences between <b>"GET" and "POST"</b> The HTML specifications technically define the difference between "GET" and "POST" so that former means that form data is to be encoded (by a browser) into a URL while the latter means that the form data is to appear within a message body. But the specifications also give the usage recommendation that the "GET" method should be used when the form processing is "idempotent", and in those cases only. As a simplification, we might say that "GET" is basically for just getting (retrieving) data whereas "POST" may involve anything, like storing or updating data, or ordering a product, or sending E-mail.</p>

    		<h3>4.6: Validation</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p> <b>Validation</b> Verification on the server side that we expect to see what we expected to see </p>

				<p> Data validation is the process of ensuring that computer input is clean, correct, and useful. Typical validation tasks are: 1) has the user filled in all required fields? 2) has the user entered a valid date? 3) has the user entered text in a numeric field?</p>


				<p> Most often, the purpose of data validation is to ensure correct input to a computer application. Validation can be defined by many different methods, and deployed in many different ways.</p>

				<p> <b>Server side validation </b> is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server.</p>


				<p> <b>Client side validation </b> is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to a web server.</p>

				<p>String Substitution</p> With String Substitution you can replace a string with the % sign. Than you can call the string with %OTHERSTRING when the OTHERSTRING can also be a variable. 

				<p><b>Escaping</b> HTML allows you to escape certain methods or change them. Correct way to include text in rendered HTML.</p>

				<h3>4.7: HTML Templates</h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p> Templates are a great way to seperate different types of code, make more readable code, more secure websites, and HTML is easy to modify.  </p>

				<p> There is a better way using Template - a template library is a library to build complicated stings </p>


				<p> HTML embedded in code is messy and difficult to maintain. It's better to use a templating system, where the HTML is kept in a separate file with special syntax to indicate where the data from the application appears. There are many templating systems for Python: EZT, Cheetah, ClearSilver, Quixote, Django, and Jinja2 are just a few. You can use your template engine of choice by bundling it with your application code.App Engine includes the Django and Jinja2 templating engines.</p>

				<p> <b> Helpful Tips</b> 1)  Always automatically escape variables when possible. 2) Minimize the code that you include in templates 3) Minimize html in code (good rule is zero html in code)</p>

				<p> Use Template Inheritance: This lets you define a base template which you can later plug new HTML into. This is useful when, for example, you want to have a consistent header and footer across your app. </p>

				<p> <b>For Loops</b>Add Repeated Elements: If you've got many divs that all have the same structure, it's much better to use a for loop.  </p>

    			<h3>4.8: Database </h3>
          	<p class="one">
          		<p> How the data is stored in a database is probably much simpler than you might think. Databases use a series of Tables to store the data. A table simply refers to a two dimensional representation of your data using columns and rows. </p>

				<p> How does the database keep things straight? Well, first each database table is given a unique name. Without a unique name the DBMS (DataBase Management System) would get very confused.</p>


				<p> The next thing to understand about your table is the Primary Key. The Primary Key simply refers to a column in your table that is guaranteed unique. The Primary Key is then used for the purposes of indexing your table which makes it much more efficient to search, sort, link, etc.</p>

				<p> <b> Datastore</b> Storing data in a scalable web application can be tricky. A user could be interacting with any of dozens of web servers at a given time, and the user's next request could go to a different web server than the previous request. All web servers need to be interacting with data that is also spread out across dozens of machines, possibly in different locations around the world.</p>

				<p> App Engine's data repository, the High Replication Datastore (HRD), uses the Paxos algorithm to replicate data across multiple datacenters. Data is written to the Datastore in objects known as entities. Each entity has a key that uniquely identifies it. An entity can optionally designate another entity as its parent; the first entity is a child of the parent entity. The entities in the Datastore thus form a hierarchically-structured space similar to the directory structure of a file system. An entity's parent, parent's parent, and so on recursively, are its ancestors; its children, children's children, and so on, are its descendants. An entity without a parent is a root entity. </p>

				<p>The Datastore is extremely resilient in the face of catastrophic failure, but its consistency guarantees may differ from what you're familiar with. Entities descended from a common ancestor are said to belong to the same entity group; the common ancestor's key is the group's parent key, which serves to identify the entire group. Queries over a single entity group, called ancestor queries, refer to the parent key instead of a specific entity's key. Entity groups are a unit of both consistency and transactionality: whereas queries over multiple entity groups may return stale, eventually consistent results, those limited to a single entity group always return up-to-date, strongly consistent results. </p>

				<p>Every Datastore query computes its results using one or more indexes, tables containing entities in a sequence specified by the index's properties and, optionally, the entity's ancestors. The indexes are updated incrementally to reflect any changes the application makes to its entities, so that the correct results of all queries are available with no further computation needed. </p>

				<p>An index is defined on a list of properties of a given entity kind, with a corresponding order (ascending or descending) for each property. For use with ancestor queries, the index may also optionally include an entity's ancestors. </p>

				<p><b>ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</b></p>

				<p><b>A</b> All parts of a transaction succeed or fail together </p>

				<p><b>C</b> The database will always be consistent  </p>

				<p><b>I</b> No transaction can interfere with another's  </p>

				<p><b>D</b> Once the transaction is committed it won't be lost   </p>
